# PromptPaste

Use AI on selected text anywhere in GNOME.

Correct writing, rewrite text, translate, summarize, fix code, or create your own actions. Select some text, trigger an action, and PromptPaste can preview or paste the result back automatically.

## Installation

Install PromptPaste from [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10540/ai-autocorrect/).

Supports GNOME Shell 46–50.

After installation, open the extension settings to choose your provider, model, API key, shortcuts, and actions.

### Manual installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubaimutl/PromptPaste.git
cd PromptPaste
gnome-extensions pack --force
gnome-extensions install --force promptpaste*.zip
gnome-extensions enable ai-autocorrect@ubai.dev
```

Log out and back in if the extension does not appear immediately.

## Providers

Add your own API key in the extension settings:

- Ollama: https://ollama.com
- Groq: https://console.groq.com/keys
- Gemini: https://ai.google.dev/aistudio
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Cerebras: https://cloud.cerebras.ai
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Vercel AI Gateway: https://vercel.com/ai-gateway

PromptPaste itself does not charge anything. Provider pricing and free-tier limits depend on the provider and may change.

## Custom actions

Custom actions can use the active provider and model or override them individually.

Each custom action can treat selected text as content to transform or as the user prompt itself. Prompt-mode actions send the exact selection as the user message and can add optional system guidance. The built-in Run selected prompt action can also override its provider, model, and token limits.

They can also define optional input and output token limits.

**Input limits** use a lightweight token estimate and stop the action before sending if the selection is too large. PromptPaste never truncates selected text.

**Output limits** control the maximum response size requested from the provider. `Auto` uses PromptPaste's normal response-length behavior.

If a provider indicates that a response was cut off because the output limit was reached, PromptPaste rejects the partial result and asks you to increase the limit.

## Action palette

The **Open actions** shortcut can display your actions:

- centered on the active monitor
- near the pointer
- or through the normal panel menu

This makes custom actions available without moving the pointer to the top panel.

## Privacy

Clipboard or selected text is sent to your chosen provider only when you explicitly run an action.

Using previously copied clipboard text as a fallback is optional and disabled by default.

API keys are stored through the system Secret Service and can be managed with GNOME Passwords and Keys. Keys stored by older PromptPaste versions are migrated automatically and removed from GSettings after successful migration.

When using Ollama with a local server, selected text is processed locally instead of being sent to an online AI provider.

Cloud providers have their own data-retention, privacy, usage-limit, and pricing policies. Review the policy of the provider and model you choose before sending sensitive information.

## Selection capture

GNOME normally exposes selected text through the PRIMARY selection.

Firefox on Wayland can behave differently, so PromptPaste enables explicit-copy compatibility for Firefox by default. In this mode PromptPaste sends `Ctrl+C`, which temporarily changes the normal clipboard.

Other application IDs can be added in Settings if needed.

## Result handling

AI responses can be incorrect. Enable **Preview before replacing** if you want to inspect generated text first.

After an automatic replacement, **Undo last replacement** remains available in the panel menu for 60 seconds and uses the target application's native undo action.
